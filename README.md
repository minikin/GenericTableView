### Project in development!

This project inspired but [Swift Talk #26](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E26-generic-table-view-controllers-part-2) and [Swift Talk #6](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E06-generic-table-view-controllers) by [Chris Eidhof]() and [Florian Kugler](). Be sure that you have [subscribed](https://talk.objc.io/).

I'd like to try implement generic tableView data source for storyboard based apps.
